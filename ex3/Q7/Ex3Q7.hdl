/**
 *  A FSM (either Mealy or Moore) with two inputs x_t y_t and one output z. 
 *  Each input represents a digit in a base-3 number as follows: x_t y_t=00 represents zero, 
 *  x_t y_t=01 represents the digit 1, and x_t y_t=10 represents the digit 2. 
 *  The FSM prints 1 iff the base-3 number x_1 y_1…x_t y_t is divided by 4 with remainder 3. 
 *  Use JK-FF units and minimal logic.
